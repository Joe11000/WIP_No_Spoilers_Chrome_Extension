No_Spoilers
===========
Let me just watch highlights without RUINING the final score in advance!!!

Removes spoilers from video.nhl.com + ignores live game updates as they come in.  Paste JS in console after page loads.


For the non developers
1) visit 'video.nhl.com' (without looking at the final scores for God sakes)
2) right click on anything except the video feed.
3) click 'Inspect Element'
4) click 'Console' on the horizontal tab that just popped up
5) paste contents of no_spoilers.js into the bottom of the pop up.
6) Press Enter.
7) Go watch you some hockey
